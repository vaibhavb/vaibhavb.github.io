# Spanish Learning

In next three months I will be trying to learn spanish using Tim Feriss [theory]
 (http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2009/01/20/learning-language/).

Its important that you cover - what, why and how while learning a language. 

## What
What am i learning with Spanish? 
More appropriately what parts of spanish do I want to learn? I would say the
grammar and a vocabulary which helps with Why.

## Why
Why am i learning the language? What is my interest?
I would say primarily to be able to travel to spanish speaking countries like
Ecuador, Costa Rica, Mexico etal.

## How
What process should i use to learn spanish?
The process should be fluid and very natural. But at the same time it should be
done in a way that helps me keep the language fresh.

Does this mean I should watch spanish TV? Join friendly [groups]
(http://www.meetups.com) which help me learn spanish? I would say yes.
